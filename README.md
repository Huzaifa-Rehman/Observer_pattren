# Observer_pattren
# Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Observer Design Pattern in Java. The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that establishes a one-to-many relationship between objects, allowing one object (the subject) to notify multiple dependent objects (observers) of any state changes.
# Features
Observer Interface: Defines the method for receiving updates from the subject.
Subject Class: Maintains a list of observers and notifies them of any changes in state.
Concrete Observers: Implement the observer interface to perform actions based on updates from the subject.
